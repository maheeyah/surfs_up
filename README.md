# Surfs_Up
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
In order to go through the plans of opening a surf shop in Oahu, W. Avy wants to analyze temperature data for the months of June and December to determine whether the new business is sustainable year around. 

## Results:
### June Temperatures Statistics

### December Temperatures Statistics

* June has an average temperature of 74.9°F while December has an average temperature of 71.0°F. Although December is slightly cooler, the temperature still allows for surfing and ice cream.   
* The maximum temperature for June is 85°F while December's maximum temperature is 83°F. Even on the hottest days of summer or winter it still would be a great time for catching a wave and eating ice cream. 
* The minimum temperature for June is 64°F while December's minimum temperature is 56°F. These temperatures are less than ideal for a surf and ice cream shop but only 25% of the temperature reported in December was 69°F or lower and for June it was under 73°F. 

## Summary:

The results of these analyses show that Oahu has ideal temperatures in the months of June and December for a surf and ice cream shop. But although that may be the case, for any business, there are other factors that could affect business.
Before opening up the shop additional queries need to be done, such as looking at precipitation and temperature based on the time of day. If the coolest temperatures are at the end of the day, afternoon surfing activities may not be affected. But if precipitation is more likely to occur early in the day, surfers may not go out early morning. 
Looking at other data would also be beneficial, such as wind speeds, thunder/lightning, cloudiness, fog, and other data that was not provided in the database currently being used.
